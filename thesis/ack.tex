\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Luc van Gool for offering me the opportunity to do a semester project in the CVL group. 

My special thanks goes to my direct supervisor Dr. Dengxin Dai for his advice and assistance during the course of this semester project. Moreover, I wish to acknowledge the help provided by Vaishakh Patil with preparing the input feature maps.

Finally I would like to offer my great appreciation to my parents for their never-ending enthusiasm and support throughout my study.
